== ey-deploy

You have an environment called  foo_production  on the ey cloud

You boot a server with an app attached called railsapp from a git repo

Once the server fully comes up ssh into it and run this:

  # as root
  gem install ey-deploy --source http://gems.engineyard.com
  ey-deploy-install

Now back on your local machine, 

  cd railsapp
  git remote add foo_production deploy@12.123.12.123:/data/railsapp/shared/cached-copy

Then make a small change to the rails app and commit it to git, then run this command:

  git push foo_production master

Thats it! you are now deploying with git directly to your instance
