== ey-deploy

You have an environment called  foo_production  on the ey cloud

You boot a server with an app attached called railsapp from a git repo

Once the server fully comes up ssh into it and run this:

  # as root on the app master only
  ip-10-212-99-148 ~ # gem install ey-deploy --source http://gems.engineyard.com
  Successfully installed ey-deploy-0.0.7
  1 gem installed
  ip-10-212-99-148 ~ # ey-deploy-install
  engineyard git hooks installed
  ip-10-212-99-148 ~ # 

Now back on your local machine, 

  cd railsapp
  git remote add foo_production deploy@12.123.12.123:/data/railsapp/shared/cached-copy

# NOTE  make sure to replace 'deploy' with the username you created for this env
# NOTE  also make sure to change the ip address to the addr of your app master

Then make a small change to the rails app and commit it to git, then run this command:

  git push foo_production master

Thats it! you are now deploying with git directly to your instances
